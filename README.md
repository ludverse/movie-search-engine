# movie-search-engine
A very bad and basic search engine for searching American movies. It has also now got an indexer, which increases the search speed by 74 times compared to previous versions! It's still not the best optimized and there are loads of improvements that can be made, so if anyone wanna contribute lol ;), submit a pull request!

# Dataset
The movies dataset I'm using is at [github.com:prust/wikipedia-movie-data](https://github.com/prust/wikipedia-movie-data/blob/master/movies.json) (thanks prust!) that you will have to put at `src/data/movies.json`.
