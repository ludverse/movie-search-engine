# movie-search-engine
A very bad and basic search engine for searching American movies. It's not optimised and doesn't use any sort of indexing algoritm at all as of right now, so it's extremly slow. Don't @ me

# Dataset
The movies dataset I'm using is at [github.com:prust/wikipedia-movie-data](https://github.com/prust/wikipedia-movie-data/blob/master/movies.json) that you will have to put at `src/data/movies.json`.
